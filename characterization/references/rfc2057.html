Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Abstract</span>

   This memo was developed from a deposition that I submitted as part of
   a challenge to the Communications Decency Act of 1996, part of the
   Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996.  The Telecommunications Reform
   Act is a U.S. federal law substantially changing the regulatory
   structure in the United States in the telecommunications arena.  The
   Communications Decency Act (CDA) part of this law has as its aim the
   desire to protect minors from some of the material carried over
   telecommunications networks.  In particular the law requires that the
   sender of potentially offensive material take &quot;effective action&quot; to
   ensure that it is not presented to minors.  A number of people have
   requested that I publish the deposition as an informational RFC since
   some of the information in it may be useful where descriptions of the
   way the Internet and its applications work could help clear up
   confusion in the technical feasibility of proposed content control
   regulations.

   No organization or entity operates or controls the Internet.  The
   Internet consists of tens of thousands of local networks linking
   millions of computers, owned by governments, public institutions,
   non-profit organizations, and private companies around the world.
   These local networks are linked together by thousands of Internet
   service providers which interconnect at dozens of points throughout
   the world.  None of these entities, however, controls the Internet;
   each entity only controls its own computers and computer networks,
   and the links allowed into those computers and computer networks.

   Although no organizations control the Internet, a limited number of
   organizations are responsible for the development of communications
   and operational standards and protocols used on the Internet.  These
   standards and protocols are what allow the millions of different (and
   sometimes incompatible) computers worldwide to communicate with each

   other.  These standards and protocols are not imposed on any computer
   or computer network, but any computer or computer network must follow
   at least some of the standards and protocols to be able to
   communicate with other computers over the Internet.

   The most significant of the organizations involved in defining these
   standards include the Internet Society (ISOC), the Internet
   Architecture Board (IAB), Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG),
   and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).   The following
   summary outlines the relationship of these four organizations:

   The Internet Society (ISOC) is a professional society that is
   concerned with the growth and evolution of the worldwide Internet,
   with the way in which the Internet is and can be used, and with the
   social, political, and technical issues which arise as a result.  The
   ISOC Trustees are responsible for approving appointments to the IAB
   from among the nominees submitted by the IETF nominating committee
   and ratifying the IETF Standards Process.

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is a technical advisory group
   of the ISOC.  It is chartered to provide oversight of the
   architecture of the Internet and its protocols, and to serve, in the
   context of the Internet standards process, as a body to which the
   decisions of the IESG may be appealed.  The IAB is responsible for
   approving appointments to the IESG from among the nominees submitted
   by the IETF nominations committee and advising the IESG on the
   approval of Working Group charters.

   The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) is responsible for
   technical management of IETF activities and the Internet standards
   process.  As a part of the ISOC, it administers the process according
   to the rules and procedures which have been ratified by the ISOC
   Trustees.  The IESG is directly responsible for the actions
   associated with entry into and movement along the Internet &quot;standards
   track,&quot; including final approval of specifications as Internet
   Standards.

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a self-organized group
   of people who make technical and other contributions to the
   engineering and evolution of the Internet and its technologies.  It
   is the principal body engaged in the development of new Internet
   standard specifications.  The IETF is divided into eight functional
   areas.  They are: Applications, Internet, IP: Next Generation,
   Network Management, Operational Requirements, Routing, Security,
   Transport and User Services.  Each area has one or two area
   directors.  These area directors, along with the IETF/IESG Chair,
   form the IESG.

   In addition to these organizations, there are a variety of other
   formal and informal groups that develop standards and agreements
   about specialized or emerging areas of the Internet.   For example,
   the World Wide Web Consortium has developed agreements and standards
   for the Web.

   None of these organizations controls, governs, runs, or pays for the
   Internet.  None of these organizations controls the substantive
   content available on the Internet.  None of these organizations has
   the power or authority to require content providers to alter, screen,
   or restrict access to content on the Internet other than content that
   they themselves create.

   Beyond the standards setting process, the only Internet functions
   that are centralized are the allocation of numeric addresses to
   networks and the registration of &quot;domain names.&quot;  Three entities
   around the world share responsibility for ensuring that each network
   and computer on the Internet has a unique 32-bit numeric &quot;IP&quot; address
   (such as 123.32.22.132), and for ensuring that all &quot;domain names&quot;
   (such as &quot;harvard.edu&quot;) are unique.  InterNIC allocates IP addresses
   for the Americas, and has counterparts in Europe and Asia.  InterNIC
   allocates large blocks of IP addresses to major Internet providers,
   who in turn allocate smaller blocks to smaller Internet providers
   (who in turn allocate even smaller blocks to other providers or end
   users).  InterNIC does not, however, reliably receive information on
   who receives each numeric IP address, and thus cannot provide any
   central database of computer addresses.  In addition, a growing
   number of computers access the Internet indirectly through address
   translating devices such as application &quot;firewalls&quot;.  With these
   devices the IP address used by a computer on the &quot;inside&quot; of the
   firewall is translated to another IP address for transmission over
   the Internet.  The IP address used over the Internet can be
   dynamically assigned from a pool of available IP addresses at the
   time that a communication is initiated.  In this case the IP
   addresses used inside the firewall is not required to be globally
   unique and the IP addresses used over the Internet do not uniquely
   identify a specific computer.  Neither the InterNIC nor its
   counterparts in Europe and Asia control the substantive content
   available on the Internet, nor do they have the power or authority to
   require content providers to alter, screen, or restrict access to
   content on the Internet.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Characteristics of Internet communications</span>

   There are a wide variety of methods of communications over the
   Internet, including electronic mail, mail exploders such as listserv,
   USENET newsgroups, Internet Relay Chat, gopher, FTP, and the World
   Wide Web.  With each of these forms of communication, the speaker has
   little or no way to control or verify who receives the communication.

   As detailed below, for each of these methods of communications, it is
   either impossible or very difficult for the speaker to restrict
   access to his or her communications &quot;by requiring use of a verified
   credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal
   identification number.&quot; Similarly, for each of these methods of
   communication, there are no feasible actions that I know of that the
   speaker can take that would be reasonably effective to &quot;restrict or
   prevent access by minors&quot; to the speaker&#x27;s communications.

   With each of these methods of communications, it is either
   technologically impossible or practically infeasible for the speaker
   to ensure that the speech is not &quot;available&quot; to a minor.  For most of
   these methods--mail exploders such as listserv, USENET newsgroups,
   Internet Relay Chat, gopher, FTP, and the World Wide Web--there are
   technological obstacles to a speaker knowing about or preventing
   access by minors to a communication.  Yet even for the basic point-
   to-point communication of electronic mail, there are practical and
   informational obstacles to a speaker ensuring that minors do not have
   access to a communication that might be considered &quot;indecent&quot; or
   &quot;patently offensive&quot; in some communities.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a> Point-to-Point Communications</span>

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1.1" href="#section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>  Electronic Mail.</span>

   Of all of the primary methods of communication on the Internet, there
   is the highest likelihood that the sender of electronic mail will
   personally know the intended recipient (and know the intended
   recipient&#x27;s true e-mail address), and thus the sender (i.e., the
   speaker or content provider) may be able to transmit potentially
   &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot; content with relatively little
   concern that the speech might be &quot;available&quot; to minors.

   There is significantly greater risk for the e-mail speaker who does
   not know the intended recipient.  As a hypothetical example, if an
   AIDS information organization receives from an unknown individual a
   request for information via electronic mail, the organization has no
   practical or effective way to verify the identity or age of the e-
   mail requester.

   An electronic mail address provides no authoritative information
   about the addressee.  Addresses are often chosen by the addressees
   themselves, and may or may not be based on the addressees&#x27; real
   names.  For millions of people with e-mail addresses, no additional
   information is available over the Internet.  Where information is
   available (via, for example, inquiry tools such as &quot;finger&quot;), it is
   usually provided by the addressee, and thus may not be accurate
   (especially in a case of a minor seeking to obtain information the
   government has restricted to adults).

   There exists no universal or even extensive &quot;white pages&quot; listing of
   e-mail addresses and corresponding names or telephone numbers.  Given
   the rapidly expanding and global nature of the Internet, any attempt
   as such a listing likely will be incomplete (and likely will not
   contain information about the age of the e-mail addressee).  Nor is
   there any systematic, practical, and efficient method to obtain the
   identity of an e-mail address holder from the organization or
   institution operating the addressee&#x27;s computer system.

   Moreover, it is relatively simple for someone to create an e-mail
   &quot;alias&quot; to send and receive mail under a different name.  Thus, a
   given e-mail address may not even be the true e-mail address of the
   recipient.  On some systems, for example, an individual seeking to
   protect his or her anonymity could easily create a temporary e-mail
   address for the sole purpose of requesting information from an AIDS
   information resource.  In addition, there exist &quot;anonymous remailers&quot;
   which replace the original e-mail address on messages with a randomly
   chosen new one.  The remailer keeps a record of the relationship
   between the original and the replacement name so that return mail
   will get forwarded to the right person.  These remailers are used
   frequently for discussion or support groups on sensitive or
   controversial topics such as AIDS.

   Thus, there is no reasonably effective method by which one can obtain
   information from existing online information sources about an e-mail
   address sufficient to ensure that a given address is used by an adult
   and not a minor.

   Absent the ability to comply with the Communications Decency Act
   based on information from existing online information sources, an e-
   mail speaker&#x27;s only recourse is to interrogate the intended e-mail
   recipient in an attempt to verify that the intended recipient is an
   adult.  Such verification inherently and unavoidably imposes the
   burden of an entirely separate exchange of communications prior to
   sending the e-mail itself, and is likely to be unreliable if the
   recipient intends to deceive the speaker.





<span class="grey">Bradner                      Informational                      [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2057">RFC 2057</a>             Source Directed Access Control        November 1996</span>


   This separate preliminary communication is required because with
   electronic mail, there is a complete electronic and temporal
   &quot;disconnect&quot; between the sender and recipient.  Electronic mail can
   be routed through numerous computers between the sender and the
   recipient, and the recipient may not &quot;log in&quot; to retrieve mail until
   days or even weeks after the sender sent the mail.  Thus, at no point
   in time is there any direct or even indirect electronic linkage
   between sender and recipient that would allow the sender to
   interrogate the recipient prior to sending an e-mail.  Thus,
   unavoidably, the Communications Decency Act requires that the sender
   incur the administrative (and in some cases financial) cost of an
   entirely separate exchange of communications between sender and
   recipient prior to the sender having sufficient information to ensure
   that the recipient is an adult.   Even if the sender were to
   establish that an e-mail addressee is not a minor, the sender could
   not be sure that the addressee was not sharing their computer account
   with someone else, as is frequently done, who is a minor.

   If an e-mail is part of a commercial transaction of sufficient value
   to justify the time and expense of obtaining payment via credit card
   from the e-mail addressee, an e-mail sender may be able to utilize
   the credit card or debit account options set out in the
   Communications Decency Act.  At this time, however, one cannot verify
   a credit or debit transaction over the Internet, and thus an e-mail
   speaker would have to incur the expense of verifying the transaction
   via telephone or separate computer connection to the correct banking
   entity.  Because of current concerns about data security on the
   Internet, such an e-mail credit card transaction would likely also
   require that the intended e-mail recipient transmit the credit card
   information to the e-mail sender via telephone or the postal service.

   Similarly, utilizing the &quot;adult access code&quot; or &quot;adult personal
   identification number&quot; options set out in the statute would at this
   time require the creation and maintenance of a database of adult
   codes.  While such a database would not be an insurmountable
   technological problem, it would require a significant amount of human
   clerical time to create and maintain the information.  As with the
   credit or debit transactions, an adult code database would also
   likely require that information be transmitted by telephone or postal
   mail.

   Moreover, such an adult access code would likely be very ineffective
   at screening access by minors.  For the adult access code concept to
   work at all, any such code would have to be transmitted over the
   Internet, and thus would be vulnerable to interception and
   disclosure.  Any sort of &quot;information based&quot; code--that is, a code
   that consists of letters and numbers transmitted in a message--could
   be duplicated and circulated to other users on the Internet.  It is



<span class="grey">Bradner                      Informational                      [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2057">RFC 2057</a>             Source Directed Access Control        November 1996</span>


   highly likely that valid adult access codes would themselves become
   widely distributed on the Internet, allowing industrious minors to
   obtain a valid code and thus obtain access the material sought to be
   protected.

   A somewhat more effective alternative to this type of &quot;information
   based&quot; access code would be to link such a code to the unique 32-bit
   numeric &quot;IP&quot; addresses of networks and computers on the Internet.
   Under this approach, &quot;adult&quot; information would only be transmitted to
   the particular computer with the &quot;approved&quot; IP address.  For tens of
   millions of Internet users, however, IP addresses for a given access
   session are dynamically assigned at the time of the access, and those
   users will almost certainly utilize different IP addresses in
   succeeding sessions.  For example, users of the major online services
   such as America Online (AOL) are only allocated a temporary IP
   address at the time they link to the service, and the AOL user will
   not retain that IP address in later sessions.  Also, as discussed
   above, the use of &quot;firewalls&quot; can dynamically alter the apparent IP
   address of computers accessing the Internet.  Thus, any sort of IP
   address-based screening system would exclude tens of millions of
   potential recipients, and thus would not be a viable screening
   option.

   At bottom, short of incurring the time and expense of obtaining and
   charging the e-mail recipient&#x27;s credit card, there are no reasonably
   effective methods by which an e-mail sender can verify the identity
   or age of an intended e-mail recipient even in a one-to-one
   communication to a degree of confidence sufficient to ensure
   compliance with the Communications Decency Act (and avoid the Act&#x27;s
   criminal sanction).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a> Point-to-Multipoint Communications</span>

   The difficulties described above for point-to-point communications
   are magnified many times over for point-to-multipoint communications.
   In addition, for almost all major types of point-to-multipoint
   communications on the Internet, there is a technological obstacle
   that makes it impossible or virtually impossible for the speaker to
   control who receives his or her speech.  For these types of
   communications over the Internet, reasonably effective compliance
   with the Communications Decency Act is impossible.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.1" href="#section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a> Mail Exploders</span>

   Essentially an extension of electronic mail allowing someone to
   communicate with many people by sending a single e-mail, &quot;mail
   exploders&quot; are an important means by which the Internet user can
   exchange ideas and information on particular topics with others

   interested in the topic.  &quot;Mail exploders&quot; is a generic term covering
   programs such as &quot;listserv&quot; and &quot;Majordomo.&quot; These programs typically
   receive electronic mail messages from individual users, and
   automatically retransmit the message to all other users who have
   asked to receive postings on the particular list.  In addition to
   listserv and Majordomo, many e-mail retrieval programs contain the
   option to receive messages and automatically forward the messages to
   other recipients on a local mailing list.

   Mail exploder programs are relatively simple to establish.  The
   leading programs such as listserv and Majordomo are available for
   free, and once set up can generally run unattended.  There is no
   practical way to measure how many mailing lists have been established
   worldwide, but there are certainly tens of thousands of such mailing
   lists on a wide range of topics.

   With the leading mail exploder programs, users typically can add or
   remove their names from the mailing list automatically, with no
   direct human involvement.  To subscribe to a mailing list, a user
   transmits an e-mail to the automated list program.  For example, to
   subscribe to the &quot;Cyber-Rights&quot; mailing list (relating to censorship
   and other legal issues on the Internet) one sends e-mail addressed to
   &quot;listserv@cpsr.org&quot; and includes as the first line of the body of the
   message the words &quot;subscribe cyber-rights name&quot; (inserting a person&#x27;s
   name in the appropriate place).  In this example, the listserv
   program operated on the cpsr.org computer would automatically add the
   new subscriber&#x27;s e-mail address to the mailing list.  The name
   inserted is under the control of the person subscribing, and thus may
   not be the actual name of the subscriber.

   A speaker can post to a mailing list by transmitting an e-mail
   message to a particular address for the mailing list.  For example,
   to post a message to the &quot;Cyber-Rights&quot; mailing list, one sends the
   message in an e-mail addressed to &quot;cyber-rights@cpsr.org&quot;.  Some
   mailing lists are &quot;moderated,&quot; and messages are forwarded to a human
   moderator who, in turn, forwards messages that moderator approves of
   to the whole list.   Many mailing lists, however, are unmoderated and
   postings directed to the appropriate mail exploder programs are
   automatically distributed to all users on the mailing list.  Because
   of the time required to review proposed postings and the large number
   of people posting messages, most mailing lists are not moderated.

   An individual speaker posting to a mail exploder mailing list cannot
   control who has subscribed to the particular list.  In many cases,
   the poster cannot even find out the e-mail address of who has
   subscribed to the list.  A speaker posting a message to a list thus
   has no way to screen or control who receives the message.  Even if
   the mailing list is &quot;moderated,&quot; an individual posting to the list
   still cannot control who receives the posting.

   Moreover, the difficulty in knowing (and the impossibility of
   controlling) who will receive a posting to a mailing list is
   compounded by the fact that it is possible that mail exploder lists
   can themselves be entered as a subscriber to a mailing list.  Thus,
   one of the &quot;subscribers&quot; to a mailing list may in fact be another
   mail exploder program that re-explodes any messages transmitted using
   the first mailing list.  Thus, a message sent to the first mailing
   list may end up being distributed to many entirely separate mailing
   lists as well.

   Based on the current operations and standards of the Internet, it
   would be impossible for someone posting to a listserv to screen
   recipients to ensure the recipients were over 17 years of age.  Short
   of not speaking at all, I know of no actions available to a speaker
   today that would be reasonably effective at preventing minors from
   having access to messages posted to mail exploder programs.
   Requiring such screening for any messages that might be &quot;indecent&quot; or
   &quot;patently offensive&quot; to a minor would have the effect of banning such
   messages from this type of mailing list program.

   Even if one could obtain a listing of the e-mail addresses that have
   subscribed to a mailing list, one would then be faced with the same
   obstacles described above that face a point-to-point e-mail sender.
   Instead of obtaining a credit card or adult access code from a single
   intended recipient, however, a posted to a mailing list may have to
   obtain such codes from a thousand potential recipients, including new
   mailing list subscribers who may have only subscribed moments before
   the poster wants to post a message.  As noted above, complying with
   the Communications Decency Act for a single e-mail would be very
   difficult.  Complying with the Act for a single mailing list posting
   with any reasonable level of effectiveness is impossible.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.2.2" href="#section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>  USENET Newsgroups.</span>

   One of the most popular forms of communication on the Internet is the
   USENET newsgroup.  USENET newsgroups are similar in objective to mail
   exploder mailing lists--to be able to communicate easily with others
   who share an interest in a particular topic--but messages are
   conveyed across the Internet in a very different manner.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2057">RFC 2057</a>             Source Directed Access Control        November 1996</span>


   USENET newsgroups are distributed message databases that allow
   discussions and exchanges on particular topics.   USENET newsgroups
   are disseminated using ad hoc, peer-to-peer connections between
   200,000 or more computers (called USENET &quot;servers&quot;) around the world.
   There are newsgroups on more than twenty thousand different subjects.
   Collectively, almost 100,000 new messages (or &quot;articles&quot;) are posted
   to newsgroups each day.   Some newsgroups are &quot;moderated&quot; but most
   are open access.

   For unmoderated newsgroups, when an individual user with access to a
   USENET server posts a message to a newsgroup, the message is
   automatically forwarded to adjacent USENET servers that furnish
   access to the newsgroup, and it is then propagated to the servers
   adjacent to those servers, etc.  The messages are temporarily stored
   on each receiving server, where they are available for review and
   response by individual users.  The messages are automatically and
   periodically purged from each system after a configurable amount of
   time to make room for new messages.  Responses to messages--like the
   original messages--are automatically distributed to all other
   computers receiving the newsgroup.  The dissemination of messages to
   USENET servers around the world is an automated process that does not
   require direct human intervention or review.

   An individual who posts a message to a newsgroup has no ability to
   monitor or control who reads the posted message.  When an individual
   posts a message, she transmits it to a particular newsgroup located
   on her local USENET server.  The local service then automatically
   routes the message to other servers (or in some cases to a
   moderator), which in turn allow the users of those servers to read
   the message.  The poster has no control over the handling of her
   message by the USENET servers worldwide that receive newsgroups.
   Each individual server is configured by its local manager to
   determine which newsgroups it will accept.   There is no mechanism to
   permit distribution based on characteristics of the individual
   messages within a newsgroup.

   The impossibility of the speaker controlling the message distribution
   is made even more clear by the fact that new computers and computer
   networks can join the USENET news distribution system at any time.
   To obtain newsgroups, the operator of a new computer or computer
   network need only reach agreement with a neighboring computer that
   already receives the newsgroups.  Speakers around the world do not
   learn that the new computer had joined the distribution system.
   Thus, just as a speaker cannot know or control who receives a
   message, the speaker does not even know how many or which computers
   might receive a given newsgroup.

   For moderated newsgroups, all messages to the newsgroup are forwarded
   to an individual who can screen them for relevance to the topics
   under discussion.  The screening process, however, does not increase
   the ability of the original speaker to control who receives a given
   message.  A newsgroup moderator has as little control as the original
   speaker over who receives a message posted to the newsgroup.

   Based on the current operations and standards of the Internet, it
   would be impossible for someone posting to a USENET newsgroup to
   screen recipients to ensure that the recipients were over 17 years of
   age.  Short of not speaking at all, I know of no actions available to
   a speaker today that would be reasonably effective at preventing
   minors from having access to USENET newsgroup messages.  Requiring
   such screening for any messages that might be &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
   offensive&quot; to a minor would have the effect of banning such messages
   from USENET newsgroups.

   A speaker also has no means by which he or she could require
   listeners to provide a credit card, debit account, adult access code,
   or adult personal identification number.  Each individual USENET
   server controls access to the newsgroups on that server, and a
   speaker has no ability to force a server operator to take any
   particular action.  The message is out of the speaker&#x27;s hands from
   the moment the message is posted.

   Moreover, even if one hypothesized a system under which a newsgroup
   server would withhold access to a message until the speaker received
   a credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal
   identification number from the listener, there would be no feasible
   way for the speaker to receive such a number.  Because a listener may
   retrieve a message from a newsgroup days after the speaker posted the
   message, such a hypothetical system would require the speaker either
   to remain at his or her computer 24 hours a day for as many as ten
   days after posting the message, or to finance, develop, and maintain
   an automated system to receive and validate access numbers.  All of
   this effort would be required for the speaker to post even a single
   potentially &quot;patently offensive&quot; message to a single newsgroup.

   Moreover, even if such a hypothetical system did exist and a speaker
   were willing to remain available 24 hours a day (or operate a costly
   automated system) in order to receive access numbers, not all
   computers that receive USENET newsgroups could reasonably transmit
   such access numbers.  Some computers that receive newsgroups do so
   only by a once-a-day telephone connection to another newsgroup
   server.  Some of these computers do not have any other type of
   Internet connection, and indeed some computers that receive USENET
   newsgroups do not even utilize the TCP/IP communications protocol
   that is required for direct or real time communications on the
