Abstract

   This RFC describes a method of encapsulating IP datagrams on top of
   Acoustical Transmission Media (ATM).  This is a non-recommended
   standard.  Distribution of this memo is unnecessary.

Overview

   The modern laptop computer of today often contains the hardware
   needed to perform wireless communications by using Acoustical
   Transmission Media, i.e. sound waves.  Until this moment there has
   been no standard on how to run IP on such media.  This document is an
   attempt to fill this silence.

Frame transmission

   The IP datagram is divided into four-bit chunks, in network beep
   order, and converted to characters according to the table below.  A
   single &quot;b&quot; character is prepended as a frame start signal, the
   characters are then transmitted in ordinary morse code by modulating
   a steady tone on and off.  The frequency of this tone is also known
   as the Acoustical Signature (AS number) of the sender.

   To allow more than one Local Acoustical Network (LAN) to coexist the
   use of different AS numbers for different LANs is suggested.  This
   document proposes seven standard AS numbers to be used, see the table
   below for details.

        Name   Frequency

        &quot;a&quot;     440 Hz
        &quot;b&quot;     494 Hz
        &quot;c&quot;     523 Hz
        &quot;d&quot;     587 Hz
        &quot;e&quot;     659 Hz
        &quot;f&quot;     698 Hz
        &quot;g&quot;     784 Hz

   It is assumed that for normal operation AS number &quot;a&quot;, 440 Hz will be
   used.

Frame reception

   The above process is simply performed backwards.

Security Considerations

   The author assumes that the users take whatever precautions that are
   necessary before attempting to use this protocol in any crowded area.
