                 <span class="h1">NEW MULTICS NETWORK SOFTWARE FEATURES</span>

Two recently-installed features of the Multics  Network  software
might be of general interest to the Network community, and should
be of particular interest to those who use Multics via TIP&#x27;s:

Case Mapping
---- -------

In  order  to allow Network users at upper-case-only terminals on
systems which do not  furnish  case-mapping  to  access  Multics,
typing   &quot;MAP&quot;   (upper-case,   followed   by   Telnet  New-line)
immediately after receipt of the Multics  load  message  actuates
Multics software which applies the following typing conventions:

1) as most Multics  input  is  lower-case,  alphabetic  input  is
    mapped  to  lower-case,  except  for  any  letter immediately
    preceded by &quot;
2) back (left) arrow  is  treated  as  underscore,  up  arrow  as
    circumflex, apostrophe as acute (right) accent
3) escape sequences exist for the following:
    backspace = -
    grave (left) accent = &#x27;
    left brace =
    vertical line =
    right brace = )
    tilde = =
4) the sequence &quot;\&quot; is treated as  &quot;
    octal  escape, it is only necessary to type     a &quot;
    them

The case-mapping software is also actuated if &quot;HELP&quot; (upper-case)
is  typed  prior  to  login  in  response  to the system&#x27;s &quot;login
incorrect&quot; message, in which case the normal  information  (which
would  appear  in response to lower-case &quot;help&quot; as well) on login
format will be printed out.  (Note: the escape sequences are  the
same  as  existing Multics   conventions for direct-dialled Model
33/35 TTY&#x27;s.  On these particular devices, &quot;
indicated on the key-caps: it is input as SHIFT-L.)

<span class="grey">Allocate Handling</span>
-------- --------

Output  to  systems  which give small allocations has long been a
problem, both to the remote user (who experienced frequent pauses
in the output at  his  terminal)  and  to  the  Multics  &quot;Network
Daemon&quot;  process  (which  encountered  considerable  inefficiency
because of being frequently awakened to process the  ALL  control
messages).   To alleviate this, we have introduced interrupt-time
code which processes the ALL&#x27;s and  outputs  the  next  group  of
bytes  without  causing  the Network Daemon to take a wakeup.  As
attendees of the ICCC will have already observed, response is far
superior under the new scheme.  (System  Programmers  responsible
for  NCP&#x27;s  might  be  interested  to  know  that some 75% of our
control-message processing deals with ALL&#x27;s.)
