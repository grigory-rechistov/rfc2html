                      Improvement of Flow Control

The current &quot;give back&quot; - &quot;return&quot; scheme seems to put the cart before
the horse in that the &quot;return&quot; command indicates the amount of space
the sending host is returning rather than the amount of space it has
left after decrementing by the amount specified in the &quot;give back&quot;
command.  Considering the fact that allocation counters at sending and
receiving hosts may get out of synchronization and the fact that the
receiving host has a preemptive priority in the allocation of its
resources, it is only logical that the receiving host be able to find
out exactly how much of its buffer space a sending host thinks it can
claim.

If the &quot;return&quot; command is to accurately reflect a sending host&#x27;s
current allocation, and if successive &quot;give backs&quot; are to produce
&quot;return&quot; commands which can be properly interpreted, certain race
conditions must be avoided. A &quot;give back&quot; must be answered by a
&quot;return&quot; and no more &quot;give backs&quot; can be issued until that &quot;return&quot; is
received.  In some sense, a &quot;return&quot; command as here proposed is
really a give back reply, and, perhaps, should implemented under that
name. On the sending side, the &quot;return&quot; command must not be issued as
long as a data RFNM is awaited on the link to which the &quot;return&quot;
refers. As soon as the net is clear of data messages, the &quot;return&quot; may
be sent and data transmission may continue when the RFNM for this
message containing the &quot;return&quot; command is received.

The current &quot;give back&quot; command uses fractions and has a format
different from the &quot;allocate&quot; and &quot;return&quot; commands making processing
unnecessarily complicated. By adopting the convention that allocations
can not be decremented below zero, one can safely specify absolute
decrements in a format like that of the &quot;allocate&quot; command. If the
receiving host&#x27;s estimate of a suitable decrement is inaccurate, no
harm is done and the &quot;return&quot; command in response to the &quot;give back&quot;
provides immediate corrective information.
